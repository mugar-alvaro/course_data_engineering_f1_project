# course_data_engineering_f1_project
This repository contains the final project for the Data Engineering course (Cívica): a modern ELT architecture built with Snowflake and dbt, using the historical Formula 1 dataset as the real-world domain.  The goal is to design, model, and transform a complex dataset into a robust and fully optimized analytical model.
